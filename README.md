Analyzing AWS WAF logs using Amazon Athena queries to provide the visibility needed for threat detection

Web application security is an ongoing process. AWS Web Application Firewall [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) enables real-time monitoring and blocking of potentially harmful web requests. Bot Control and Fraud Control leverages machine learning to detect and prevent sophisticated threats. To guarantee optimal security, it's crucial to regularly assess and improve your WAF configuration by leveraging traffic insights. By doing so, you can enhance the security posture of your application and efficiently mitigate malicious traffic.

This post will provide information on how to use [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to analyze WAF logs published to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and gather insights into potential attacks. If you are publishing AWS WAF logs to [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), please refer to [this post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/analyzing-aws-waf-logs-in-amazon-cloudwatch-logs/). Using Athena, it’s easy to perform ongoing analysis of your WAF by easily surfacing outliers such as top 10 IP addresses accessing your application, top 10 URI accessed, top IP addresses with token rejections, tracking of a client session and many more use cases.  

### AWS WAF Dashboards

AWS WAF provides [per web ACL traffic overview dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-dashboards.html) to provide an overview into web traffic. The dashboards are divided into 4 different categories All traffic, Bot Control, Account takeover protection, Account creation fraud prevention. For example, you would like to understand requests per top 10 countries, token status, client session thresholds etc., you can use default dashboards. But, for deeper web traffic analysis and generating data for your custom use case, you need to analyze WAF logs. Athena provides you the right integration to run queries. 

### AWS WAF logging

With [WAF logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html), you can view metadata (JSON format) about the traffic accessing your protected resources, including client IP addresses, requested resources, and more. See [Log Fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html) for a full list of available data. This information allows you to analyze traffic across various dimensions, such as client IPs, URIs, hosts, client IP country, headers, and WAF rules, providing valuable insights into your web application's security. WAF generates a unique JSON log entry for each HTTP request it handles, which can be stored and analyzed. You can send WAF logs to various destinations, including S3 buckets, CloudWatch, or using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) to send logs to third party solutions like Datadog, Splunk etc. Once a Kinesis Data Firehose is created you can associate it with a WAF webACL via CLI or console which enables WAF to send real-time logs to a required destination. 

### Prerequisites

1.	Turn on WAF logging: Follow [the post](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/waf-turn-on-logging) and publish logs to S3 bucket directly from WAF or via Kinesis Data Firehose. Preferred method is to use Kinesis Data Fire Hose for better control of log delivery.
2.	Configure Athena: WAF has a known structure to specify a partition scheme in advance. Follow [this post](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/waf-logs.html) to create a table in Athena referencing the WAF schema. Points to note when creating Athena tables
    a.	We recommend to create Athena table using the [partitioned schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/waf-logs.html#create-waf-table-partition-projection) by date. If you use direct S3 log delivery instead of using Kinesis, consider partitioning by region too.
    b.	Be sure to specify the correct Amazon S3 bucket location for storing WAF logs, as configured in the previous step. 
    c.	WAF regularly updates log fields when new features are launched, so you'll need to update your query schema to get the latest data using Athena.

### Examples of threat detection analysis using WAF logs and Athena

As mentioned earlier in this post, AWS WAF logs contain metadata required to analyze the details of the user request. AWS considers terminating and non-terminating rule actions to halt or continue processing the request down the configured rule priority order. When analyzing bot traffic, it is important to understand the aws-waf-token characteristics and [labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-tokens-labeling.html) generated by WAF intelligent threat detection. For CAPTCHA and Challenge requests, AWS WAF inspects aws-waf-token status. If the request has a valid token, its treated as COUNT match whereas if the token is invalid [absent, expired, rejected] AWS WAF presents CAPTCHA or Challenge to clients per your rule configuration.

#### Example 1: Top talkers by different criteria 

Top talkers refer to the devices, bots or users that generate the most network traffic or pose greatest potential threat to your applications. For example, you start with looking at your CloudWatch metrics and identifies a spike in the number of requests hitting your application in the last few days. Now you would like to dive-deep into the requests to understand the source of the requests by IP address, URI, HTTP headers etc. [This  query](sql/top10ip.sql) helps you to get the top 10 IP sources using Athena queries.  [This  query](sql/top10uri.sql) helps you to get the top 10 URI accessed. You can use additional filters like httprequest.uri, httprequest.httpmethod to get top talkers with respect each HTTP attribute. More examples can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/waf-logs.html#query-examples-waf-logs).


#### Example 2: Get counts of various bot traffic for a given set of days

You have configured bot rule group. You would like to get statistics on the requests that are matched with the rules in the bot rule group. [This query](sql/bot.sql) provides you output with the count of requests against different categories of  bot label matched over a specific date. 


#### Example 3: Get counts of labels per IP address

You have configured multiple AWS WAF rulesets per web ACL. You would like to get statistics on the requests that are matched with each and every rule and build a chart from the csv output. [This query](sql/alllabels_byip.sql) provides you output with the count of each label match per IP address or over a specific date. As of today, AWS WAF provides around 400+ labels and you can customize the query to add or remove the labels per your use case.


#### Example 4: Top talker with additional details 

You have configured multiple AWS WAF rulesets per web ACL. You would like to get statistics on which IP is generating most requests and details of  every rule that they match. [This query](sql/toptraffic.sql) provides the count of traffic by an IP over a range of  dates and which was the terminatingruleid. 


#### Example 5: Website Scraping and attacks

Website scraping is the process of extracting data from websites which involves software and algorithms to navigate a website trying to extract specific data. An attack is an unauthorized access to a website with an intention to degrade the website performance and breach security. From the previous example, you get the output with IP address and total requests in descending order. To understand if the particular IP address is attacking your website, use the httprequest.clientip as a filter and perform [the query](sql/alltraffic_byip.sql) to identify the URL’s the IP is trying to access. 

#### Example 6: AWS WAF tokens analysis (activity by IP and token misuse)

AWS WAF provides unique token based on the immunity time configured (with minimum of 60 seconds to a maximum of 3 days). AWS WAF presents the user with CAPTCHA or challenge after the immunity time expires. A malicious user can generate a token and reuse it via their algorithms to generate high load of requests or spread the requests across multiple IP addresses. As the token is unique per client IP, this query provides output on token ID and number of IP’s which sent the same token. The expectation is to have no more than 1 IP per WAF token.  Use [this query](sql/waftoken_byip.sql) to find if you have token misuse.

#### Example 7: Session tracking – Lifecycle of a client request (Client session activity by token)
 

### Tips to make Athena queries faster

1.	Use DATE in the Athena partition criteria
2.	Use DATE in WHERE clause and restrict to few days (last 7 days)
3.	Avoid using more than 1 UNNEST clause
4.	Avoid join with the entire dataset.

For additional information on Athena query optimization check this post. Useful filters to have in each Athena query

Use case	Athena Query Filter
last 'n' days of data / data between specific dates	date >= date_format(current_date - interval 'n' day, '%Y/%m/%d')
If multiple Web ACL log to the same bucket, then filter by webACL	webaclid = 'arn of webACL'
If a webACL is attached to multiple AWS resources, then filter by httpsourceId	httpsourceid = ‘id of the resource’. Refer here for more information.
